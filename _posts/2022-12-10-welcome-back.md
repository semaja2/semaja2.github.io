After a very long time, I have decided to start the blog again! :tada:

Much has changed since the previous blog, InsomniaX has long since been retired along with the various other Mac utilities.

The original blog was started when I was still in high school, and over the time since then I have found my self in all aspects of technology from basic IT support, to network engineering, development, electonics and now cyber security.

This time around the blog will be a place for me to post my cyber security findings, as well as any other technology related gems I find along the way

So with that said, watch this space for the next post!
